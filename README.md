## About the wrapper for IBM Notes:

- Supports only five basic elements to work with a Notes database (session, database, document, view, iterator)
- Anyway, you can still use the native Java library to do things like modify the ACL or work with RichText items.
- Supports local and remote sessions (DIIOP)
- Auto recycling of Notes objects
- Supports field size > 32K
- Good to develop standalone Java programs, Servlets or XPages programs
